# Intel Data Center Portfolio Project

This project was completed as part of Intel's Sustainability Team initiative to analyze energy availability and usage across different regions in the United States. The primary goal is to determine the best location for Intel’s new data center based on surplus energy production, renewable energy usage, and energy trends.

# Completed for Global Career Accelerator

This project was undertaken as part of the **Global Career Accelerator course for Summer 2024**. It demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and the ability to tackle real-world challenges, like Intel's sustainability efforts.

## Overview

The project involves SQL queries for data analysis and visualizations in Tableau to help Intel make data-driven decisions. The analysis focuses on:
- Identifying regions with surplus energy production.
- Understanding the distribution of renewable versus non-renewable energy.
- Aggregating power plant data for better insight into energy production by plant type and region.
- Providing recommendations for Intel’s new data center location.

## Files Included

- **Intel Portfolio Project.pdf**: This file contains the detailed analysis, SQL queries, and recommendations based on the data.
- **README.md**: Explanation of the project and how to run or understand it.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For querying datasets to gather insights into energy production and consumption.
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations that present the findings in a clear and intuitive manner.
- **Microsoft Word/Google Docs**: For documenting the project and findings.

## How to Use This Project

### Prerequisites
- **SQL environment**: If you want to run the SQL queries yourself, you will need a SQL interface.
- **Tableau**: You will need Tableau to interact with the visualizations. A link to the published Tableau workbook will be available in the project.

### Instructions

1. **SQL Queries**: The SQL queries provided in the project can be used to interact with Intel’s energy datasets. Example queries:
   - Query to find the region with the highest total energy surplus.
   - Query to find regions with the highest renewable energy production.
2. **Tableau Visualizations**: Use the shared Tableau link (if provided) to view the visualizations created from the SQL query results.

### SQL Queries Summary
- Calculate total energy produced and demand per region.
- Identify regions with the highest renewable energy production (solar, wind, hydropower).
- Calculate the percentage of renewable energy vs. total energy generation per region.
- Aggregate energy production by type (renewable vs. fossil fuels).

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis and visualizations, the Pacific Northwest is recommended as the ideal region for Intel’s new data center due to:
- **Energy Surplus**: Consistently generates more energy than it consumes.
- **Renewable Energy Production**: Leads in renewable energy sources like hydropower and wind.
- **Sustainability**: Aligns with Intel’s sustainability goals by offering a significant amount of renewable energy, making it a cost-effective and environmentally responsible choice.

### Data Source

The datasets used in this project include:
- **intel.energy_data**: Daily energy production and consumption data by region.
- **intel.power_plants**: General information on power plants, including location and primary technology.
- **intel.energy_by_plant**: Yearly energy production at the plant level, categorized by energy type (renewable or fossil fuel).

## Future Improvements

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Predict energy trends over time and anticipate future demand.
- **Expanded Analysis**: Include data from other regions outside of the U.S. or additional energy sources.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Use advanced tools like Plotly or Tableau Public to create more interactive visualizations for stakeholders.

## Conclusion

This portfolio project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, extract insights through SQL queries, and present findings using data visualization tools like Tableau. The results help Intel make informed decisions regarding the location of their new data center, while aligning with their sustainability goals.
